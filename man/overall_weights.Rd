\title{Computes weights across post-treatment groups and time periods to
deliver overall treatment effect parameters}
\usage{
overall_weights(attgt, balance_e = NULL, min_e = -Inf, max_e = Inf, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{attgt}{A group_time_att object to be aggregated}

\item{balance_e}{Drops groups that do not have at least \code{balance_e} periods
of post-treatment data.  This keeps the composition of groups constant
across different event times in an event study.
Default is NULL, in which case this is ignored.}

\item{min_e}{The minimum event time computed in the event study results.
This is useful when there are a huge number of pre-treatment periods.}

\item{max_e}{The maximum event time computed in the event study results.
This is useful when there are a huge number of post-treatment periods.}

\item{...}{extra arguments}
}
\value{
a data.frame with columns containing the group, the time period
and the amount of weight that it should get for an overall treatment
effect parameter
}
\description{
A function that returns weights on gt's to deliver overall
(averaged across groups and time periods) treatment effect parameters
}
