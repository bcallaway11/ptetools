Description: This is fairly generic code for estimating treatment effects with panel data.  The idea is to break into separate steps organizing the data, looping over groups and time periods, computing group-time average treatment effects, and aggregating group-time average treatment effects.  Often, one is able to implement a new identification/estimation procedure by simply replacing the step on estimating group-time average treatment effects.  See several different examples of this approach in the README.
