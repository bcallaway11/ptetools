TODO:

* make sure that the knots are the same across g and t
* (I think) in the function overall_weights, work with original groups and time periods instead of the adjusted ones, but just follow what `process_att_gt` does.
* I am just going to ignore the untreated group for conducting inference
  * it is difficult to operationalize in code
  * It doesn't matter for ACRT(d) at all; for ATT(d), it doesn't matter if we interpret estimates as being nonparametric.
